    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how SIMUL collects, uses and discloses
      information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.
      Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data
      protection law. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy
      clearer and more understandable.
    </p>

    <h3>APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to SIMUL’s online tools and platform,
      including the associated SIMUL mobile and desktop applications
      (collectively, the "Services"), SIMUL.co (the "Website”) and other
      interactions (e.g.,customer service inquiries,etc.) you may have with
      SIMUL. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the
      Services, website or any other aspect of SIMUL’s business.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or
      software that integrates with the Services through the SIMUL platform
      ("Third Party Services"), or any other third-party products, services or
      businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and
      use of the Services (the "Customer Agreement"), including the processing
      of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services
      accounts (collectively,"Customer Data"). The organization (e.g.,your
      employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer
      Agreement ("Customer") controls their instance of the Services (their
      "Workspace") and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions
      about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact
      the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can
      check with your workspace administrator(s) for contact information. If you
      have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created
      an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the
      invitation.
    </p>

    <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RECEIVE</h3>

    <p>
      SIMUL may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data
      ("Other Information") in a variety of ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a
          Workspace by a Customer ("Authorized Users") routinely submit Customer
          Data to SIMUL when using the Services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        • Other Information. SIMUL also collects, generates and/or receives
        Other Information: Workspace and Account Information. To create or
        update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer)
        supply SIMUL with an email address, phone number, password, domain
        and/or similar account details. your first name, last name, email
        address, and company name (if applicable).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SIMUL will collect billing and payment information which may include your
      credit card number, billing address, and other payment related information
      ("Billing Information"). Billing Information is collected and processed by
      our third-party payment processor operating as our agent. SIMUL does not
      directly obtain or process any Billing Information.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>1. Usage Information.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          2. Cookie Information. SIMUL uses cookies and similar technologies in
          our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The
          Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking
          technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information
          about you via the Website and Services and across other websites and
          online services. For more details about how we use these technologies,
          please see our [INSERT COOKIE POLICY]
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          3. Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict
          Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party
          Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer
          can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these
          integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a
          Third-Party Service may share certain information with SIMUL. For
          example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to
          be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address
          of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the
          application has elected to make available to SIMUL to facilitate the
          integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and
          notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be
          disclosed to SIMUL. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, SIMUL is
          authorized to connect, and access Other Information made available to
          SIMUL in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider.
          For example, you may choose to sign-in using your Google, or your
          company identity provider account. By signing-in using your
          Third-Party account, the Third Party will supply SIMUL any and all
          information that you have authorized the Third Party to provide to us.
          Such information may include your first and last name, unique
          identifier, e-mail address and picture. If you would like to know more
          about 3rd parties or any other information about them, you can write
          an email to compliance@SIMUL.co.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          4. Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process
          provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized
          User chooses to import is collected when using the Services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          5. Third Party Data. SIMUL may receive data about organizations,
          industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters
          related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and
          subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own
          information better or more useful. This data may be combined with
          Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data,
          such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it
          might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or
          email campaign performed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          6. Additional Information Provided to SIMUL. We receive Other
          Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in an
          activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our
          social media accounts or otherwise communicate with SIMUL.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to
      provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively,
      "Information"). However, certain Information is collected automatically
      and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not
      provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
    </p>

    <h3>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>
      Customer Data will be used by SIMUL in accordance with Customer’s
      instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and
      Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable
      law. SIMUL is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller.
      Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to
      a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export,
      share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the
      Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      SIMUL uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in
      operating our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, SIMUL
      uses Other Information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and
          business. This includes use of Other Information to support delivery
          of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service
          errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage,
          trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>• As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and
          questions. If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to
          respond.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and
          additional features. SIMUL tries to make the Services as useful as
          possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users. For example, we
          may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help
          determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to
          an Authorized User, make Services suggestions based on historical use
          and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to
          customize a Services experience or create new productivity features
          and products.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To send emails and other communications.We may send you service,
          technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of
          communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in
          our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related
          notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are
          considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In
          addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features,
          promotional communications or other news about SIMUL. These are
          marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • For billing, account management and other administrative
          matters.SIMUL may need to contact you for invoicing, account
          management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer
          accounts and keep track of billing and payments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>• To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer
      reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person,
      SIMUL may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is
      associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is
      protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is
      referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Data."
    </p>

    <h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>

    <p>
      SIMUL will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s
      instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and
      Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable
      law. Customer may also apply different settings to messages, files or
      other types of Customer Data. The deletion of Customer Data and other use
      of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or
      de-identification of certain associated Other Information. For more
      detail, please contact Customer. SIMUL may retain Other Information
      pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in
      this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after
      you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for SIMUL
      to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and
      demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and
      enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    <h3>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>
      This section describes how SIMUL may share and disclose Information.
      Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and
      disclosure of Information, and SIMUL does not control how they or any
      other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Customer’s Instructions. SIMUL will solely share and disclose
          Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including
          any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of
          Services functionality, and in compliance with applicable law and
          legal process.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Displaying the Services. When an Authorized User submits Other
          Information, it may be displayed to other Authorized Users in the same
          or connected Workspaces. For example, an Authorized User’s email
          address may be displayed with their Workspace profile. Please consult
          support@SIMUL.co for more information on Services functionality.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Collaborating with Others. The Services provide different ways for
          Authorized Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate.
          Other Information, such as an Authorized User’s profile Information,
          may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the other
          Workspace(s).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Third Party Service Providers and Partners. We may engage third
          party companies or individuals as service providers or business
          partners to process Other Information and support our business. These
          third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage
          services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Third Party Services. Customer may enable or permit Authorized Users
          to enable Third Party Services. When enabled, SIMUL may share Other
          Information with Third Party Services. Third Party Services are not
          owned or controlled by SIMUL and third parties that have been granted
          access to Other Information may have their own policies and practices
          for its collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and
          notices in these Third Party Services or contact the provider for any
          questions at compliance@SIMUL.co
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Corporate Affiliates. SIMUL may share Other Information with its
          corporate affiliates, parents and/or subsidiaries.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • During a Change to SIMUL’s Business. If SIMUL engages in a merger,
          acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or
          all of SIMUL's assets or stock, financing, public offering of
          securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar
          transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such
          activities (e.g. due diligence), some or all Other Information may be
          shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality
          arrangements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Aggregated or De-identified Data. We may disclose or use aggregated
          or de-identified Other Information for any purpose. For example, we
          may share aggregated or de-identified Other Information with prospects
          or partners for business or research purposes, such as telling a
          prospective SIMUL customer the average amount of time spent within a
          typical Workspace.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To Comply with Laws. If we receive a request for information, we may
          disclose Other Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in
          accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal
          process. Except as expressly permitted by the Contract or in cases of
          emergency to avoid death or physical harm to individuals, SIMUL will
          only disclose Customer Data in response to valid and binding
          compulsory legal process. SIMUL requires a search warrant issued by a
          court of competent jurisdiction (a federal court or a court of general
          criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized by the law of that State
          to issue search warrants) to disclose Customer Data. All requests by
          courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation for
          Customer Data disclosures should be sent to compliance@SIMUL.co.
          Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable
          law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific
          Customer Data sought. All requests will be construed narrowly by
          SIMUL, so please do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. SIMUL
          will notify Customer before disclosing any of Customer’s Customer Data
          so that the Customer may seek protection from such disclosure, unless
          SIMUL is prohibited from doing so or there is a clear indication of
          illegal conduct or risk of harm to people or property associated with
          the use of such Customer Data. If SIMUL is legally prohibited from
          notifying Customer prior to disclosure, SIMUL will take reasonable
          steps to notify Customer of the demand after the nondisclosure
          requirement expires. In case of international requests, SIMUL requires
          that any individual issuing legal process or legal information
          requests (e.g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to SIMUL
          properly domesticate the process or request and serve SIMUL in a
          jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept
          service on its behalf. SIMUL does not accept legal process or requests
          directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. Foreign law
          enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance
          Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a
          court where SIMUL is located.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety. To protect and
          defend the rights, property or safety of SIMUL or third parties,
          including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with
          investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • With Consent. SIMUL may share Other Information with third parties
          when we have consent to do so.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SECURITY</h3>

    <p>
      SIMUL implements reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect
      your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
      disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks
      involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with
      applicable laws and regulations. SIMUL is SOC 2 Type II compliant and will
      continue to be SOC 2 Type II compliant. SIMUL conducts penetration tests
      and audits of its servers and networks every quarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We
      cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that
      the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted
      to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from
      the Service may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care
      in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any unauthorized access to or use of this Service or information collected
      and maintained by this Service should be immediately brought to our
      attention by sending us an email at compliance@SIMUL.co.

      confidentiality of Customer Data and other information, please see our

    <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

    <p>
      SIMUL may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations
      and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or
      we may make changes to our business. We will post the changes to this page
      and encourage you to review our Privacy Policy to stay informed. If we
      make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, SIMUL will provide
      additional notice, such as via email or through the Services. If you
      disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should deactivate
      your Services account. Contact the Customer if you wish to request the
      removal of Personal Data under their control.
    </p>

      outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us,
      including personal information, will be transferred from your country of
      origin to the US. We deploy the following safeguards if SIMUL transfers

          with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, SIMUL has
          certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy
          Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward
          Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access,

          (the "Privacy Shield Principles"). If there is a conflict between this
          Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
          Principles shall govern. We are committed to applying the Privacy
          Shield Principles to all personal information received from the EU,
          Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway (referred to herein as the "EU") and
          Switzerland in reliance upon the Privacy Shield. With regard to the
          Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for example, we
          remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a
          manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we
          prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the
          damage. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view

    <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>

    <p>
      To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described
      above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by email to
      compliance@SIMUL.co.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
      that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
      request related to your personal information. You may also make a
      verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
      portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
      request must:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
          you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
          authorized representative.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          • Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
          properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information
      if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and
      confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable
      consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We
      will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
      request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the
      request.
    </p>

    <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>

    <p>
      We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five
      (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will
      inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to
      that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our
      written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
      request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
      determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made
      that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
      request.
